# The-Psychology-of-Color-in-Advertising-A-Survey-Based-Experiment

This experiment investigated the impact of color in advertising on user perception and engagement. We created two groups:

**Control Group:** Saw color advertisements.
**Treatment Group:** Saw black and white versions of the same advertisements.

**Key Findings:**
People in the control group (color ads) tended to rate the advertisements higher overall.
This difference was not statistically significant, meaning it might be due to chance.
Gender seems to be a factor in how people respond to ad colors.
The study suggests including color in advertisements might be beneficial, but further research is needed.

**Limitations:**
The sample size was small.
The study relied on self-reported data, which can be subjective.
The controlled environment may not reflect real-world ad exposure.
The experiment only considered color without examining product type or overall ad design.

**Conclusion:**
While color may play a role in advertising effectiveness, this study suggests the effect is subtle.
